# Test

This Ruby gem is a *testbed* strictly for the purposes of testing and other
libraries or applications that might make use of it.

Presently the project consists of the basic parts of a typical Ruby project, such 
as a noop `lib/test.rb` file and this `README.md` file, plus a couple of other
files for testing things like the [RC](http://rubyworks.github.com) gem.

If there is something you need this project to contain for your testing purposes
please feel free to request it. As long as it does not improperly interfere with
any other part if will be accespted.
